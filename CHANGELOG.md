## Release Notes

### What's New in 0.1.0

WASM Wizard makes WebAssembly Component Model development incredibly easy by providing:

üèóÔ∏è **Project Scaffolding**: Get started instantly with production-ready templates for Rust, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

‚ö° **Smart Optimization**: Automatic size reduction of 50-80% through intelligent optimization strategies.

üîó **Component Composition**: Effortlessly combine multiple WASM components into optimized single deployments.

üõ†Ô∏è **Developer Experience**: Hot reload, automatic rebuilds, and comprehensive tooling integration.

üìä **Analysis Tools**: Deep insights into component performance, size, and structure.

### Installation

```bash
# Via npm (recommended)
npm install -g wasm-wizard

# Via cargo
cargo install wasm-wizard
```

### Quick Start

```bash
# Create a new component
wasm-wizard new my-component --language rust

# Build and optimize
cd my-component
wasm-wizard build --optimize

# Start development server
wasm-wizard dev --hot-reload
```

### Breaking Changes

None - this is the initial release.
